# Brickpresso

## A simple preso tool built with Mozilla Brick

Because funny names are funny.

Uses [Mozilla Brick](https://github.com/mozilla/brick) and a dash of Web APIs.

Works on desktop and mobile. So you can see slideshows from the comfort of your tiny little window into the world.

## Demo

Here's [a demo](http://sole.github.io/brickpresso/) that acts as documentation too. If you clone the project, it's [index.html](https://github.com/sole/brickpresso/blob/master/index.html).

## Mozilla theme

There's an ````examples```` folder with just one example (yay!). It is a [mozilla themed](examples/mozilla) version of the demo. See it [online](http://sole.github.io/brickpresso/examples/mozilla/).

## How to use it

Clone this repo, and edit ````index.html````. Depending on your tastes, edit ````css/style.css```` too.

Enjoy!
