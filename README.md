# Brickpresso

## A simple preso tool built with Mozilla Brick

Because funny names are funny.

Uses <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/brick">Mozilla Brick</a> and a dash of Web APIs.

Works on desktop and mobile. So you can see slideshows from the comfort of your tiny little window into the world.

Enjoy!
